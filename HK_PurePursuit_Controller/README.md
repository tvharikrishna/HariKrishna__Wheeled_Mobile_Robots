## About this Project:
A Pure Pursuit Controller is a Path Tracking Algorithm often used in robotics and autonomous vehicles for following a predefined path autonomously.
In autonomous robotics, the ability to follow a predetermined path with accuracy and adaptability is critical. Applications range from industrial robots following lines on a factory floor, drones navigating through an environment, or autonomous cars driving on a road. The Pure Pursuit algorithm's effectiveness has been proven in various fields, including agricultural automation, where vehicles must follow precise paths for tasks like planting or harvesting.

## Advantages of Pure Pursuit:
    • Simplicity: Pure Pursuit is straight forward to understand and implement.
    • Reactivity: It's a reactive algorithm that can adjust to changes in the robot's position.
    • Smoothness: It results in smooth paths due to the circular arc-based steering, which is important for applications where jerk or sudden changes.
    • Versatility: It can be used with different types of robots and vehicles - wheeled robots, drones, and autonomous cars can all use Pure Pursuit for path tracking.
    • Predictability: The behavior of the PP controller is predictable and reliable, which is essential for safety in autonomous systems.

## Testing and Results:
By employing a Binary Tree search algorithm for waypoint navigation, I achieved over 98% accuracy in my path tracking tests conducted in ROS. Below is a link where you can view a video demonstrating how precisely the controller follows the designated path.
