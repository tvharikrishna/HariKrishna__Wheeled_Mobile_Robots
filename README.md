<!-- Section: What is ROS? -->
<h1>ðŸ”» What is Robot Operating System (ROS)?</h1>
<p align='justify'>
Robot Operating System (ROS) is a powerful set of tools and software libraries designed to help developers build and control robots. It acts like a bridge for different parts of a robot to communicate, including sensors, motors, and software algorithms. ROS makes it easier to program robots by offering ready-to-use code and the ability to control hardware.

<h1>ðŸ”» What are Autonomous Mobile Robots?</h1>
<p align="justify">
<code>AMR</code> are robots designed to perform tasks and navigate in their environment without direct human intervention. They use a combination of sensors, cameras, software algorithms, and sometimes artificial intelligence (AI) to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and move with purpose towards a goal. Here are key features and capabilities of autonomous mobile robots:
