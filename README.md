<!-- Section: What is ROS? -->
<h1>ðŸ”» What is the Robot Operating System (ROS)?</h1>
<p align='justify'>
Robot Operating System (ROS) is a powerful set of tools and software libraries designed to help developers build and control robots. It acts like a bridge for different parts of a robot to communicate, including sensors, motors, and software algorithms. ROS makes it easier to program robots by offering ready-to-use code and the ability to control hardware.

<!-- Section: What are Wheeled Mobile Robots and Their Types? -->
<h1>ðŸ”» What are Wheeled Mobile Robots?</h1>
<p align="justify">
<strong>Mobile Robot:</strong> A wheeled mobile robot is a type of robot that moves using wheels. This design allows for easier navigation and control in various environments, making them popular for tasks ranging from industrial automation to exploration.
</p>

<h3>ðŸ’  Types of Wheeled Mobile Robots</h3>
<p align="justify">
Below is a basic overview of wheeled mobile robots. These robots vary in wheel configuration (from 2-wheel to multi-wheel designs) and size, each tailored for different tasks. The list highlights key types to introduce the fundamentals of mobile robotics.
</p>

<div align="center">

| Types | Description |
|------|-------------|
| AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robots) | Robots that can navigate and perform tasks in an environment without being directly controlled by a human. |
| AMMR (Autonomous Mobile Manipulation Robots) | Specialized in transporting and manipulating materials in environments like warehouses without human intervention. |
| AGV (Automated Guided Vehicles) | Vehicles that follow marked lines or wires on the floor, or use radio waves, vision cameras, magnets, or lasers for navigation. |
| UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicles) | Robots that operate on the ground without a human onboard, used for a variety of tasks from surveillance to exploration. |
