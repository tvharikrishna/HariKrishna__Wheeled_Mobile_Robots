<!-- Section: What is ROS? -->
<h1>ðŸ”» What is the Robot Operating System (ROS)?</h1>
<p align='justify'>
Robot Operating System (ROS) is a powerful set of tools and software libraries designed to help developers build and control robots. It acts like a bridge for different parts of a robot to communicate, including sensors, motors, and software algorithms. ROS makes it easier to program robots by offering ready-to-use code and the ability to control hardware.
