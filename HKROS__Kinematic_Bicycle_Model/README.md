<p align="center"><h1>🎀 Essence of the Project</h1></p>
<p align='justify'>
The Bicycle Kinematic Model block creates a bicycle vehicle model to simulate simplified car-like vehicle dynamics, representing a vehicle with two axles defined by the length between the axles, known as the `wheel base. The vehicle's heading, theta, is defined at the center of the rear axle, where the front wheel can be steered using an angle psi. <br>
    
▸ This kinematic approach is fundamental in <strong>autonomous driving vehicles</strong> and <strong>autonomous mobile robotics</strong>, enabling accurate motion planning and control by predicting vehicle trajectory and facilitating the implementation of advanced navigation algorithms. </p>

<!------ Deployment and Testing ------>
<p align="center"><h2>💠 Deployment and Testing </h2></p>
<p align='justify'>
▸ The deployment of the Bicycle Kinematic Model was conducted within a simulated environment using ROS, ensuring a controlled testing. I deployed the model on a standard Ubuntu system, with simulations facilitated by Matplotlib for trajectory visualization. The process included continuous integration practices to check for code integrity and automated tests to validate kinematic equations against predetermined inputs.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
▸ Testing consisted of a series of controlled simulations designed to challenge the model's capabilities in trajectory planning and response. Scenarios included navigating circular paths, sharp turns, and S-shaped trajectories, each requiring precise control of steering angles and velocity. The model's performance was gauged by its ability to maintain the intended path with minimal deviation and its response time to dynamic commands.
