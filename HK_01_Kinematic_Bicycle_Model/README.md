<p align="center"><h1>🎀 Essence of the Project</h1></p>
<p align='justify'>
The Bicycle Kinematic Model block creates a bicycle vehicle model to simulate simplified car-like vehicle dynamics, representing a vehicle with two axles defined by the length between the axles, known as the `wheel base. The vehicle's heading, theta, is defined at the center of the rear axle, where the front wheel can be steered using an angle psi. <br>
    
This kinematic approach is fundamental in <strong>autonomous driving vehicles</strong> and <strong>autonomous mobile robotics</strong>, enabling accurate motion planning and control by predicting vehicle trajectory and facilitating the implementation of advanced navigation algorithms. </p>

</p>

<p align="center"><h1>🎯 Project Vision</h1></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
▸ The Bicycle Kinematic Model is pivotal in autonomous driving and robotics for precise movement planning and execution.

▸ It converts complex vehicle dynamics into a simpler model for trajectory prediction from steering commands.

▸ Essential for path planning and control, it predicts vehicle or robot future positions for smooth navigation and path adherence.

▸ Optimizes trajectories for energy-efficient routing, extending battery life and reducing energy use.

▸ Enhances safety by enabling systems to react to unexpected obstacles or changes, minimizing accident risks.

</p>

<p align="center"><h1>🪓Project Implementation</h1></p>

<p><h2>💠 Software Design & Tools </h2></p>
<p align='justify'>
The project is developed using the Robot Operating System (ROS), facilitating complex simulations and trajectory analysis. The mathematical foundation and kinematic behavior of the bicycle model are visualized through Matplotlib, with Python scripting at the core of the development. RViz provides real-time visualization of the robot model and trajectory, enhancing the analysis and debugging process.

<!------ Deployment and Testing ------>
<p align="center"><h2>💠 Deployment and Testing </h2></p>
<p align='justify'>
▸ The deployment of the Bicycle Kinematic Model was conducted within a simulated environment using ROS, ensuring a controlled testing. I deployed the model on a standard Ubuntu system, with simulations facilitated by Matplotlib for trajectory visualization. The process included continuous integration practices to check for code integrity and automated tests to validate kinematic equations against predetermined inputs.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
▸ Testing consisted of a series of controlled simulations designed to challenge the model's capabilities in trajectory planning and response. Scenarios included navigating circular paths, sharp turns, and S-shaped trajectories, each requiring precise control of steering angles and velocity. The model's performance was gauged by its ability to maintain the intended path with minimal deviation and its response time to dynamic commands.

<!------ Result and Analysis ------>
<p align="center"><h2>💠 Results & Analysis </h2></p>

<p align='justify'>
▸ The Bicycle Kinematic Model's testing confirmed theoretical predictions with real-world behavior. Control sequences manipulated velocity and turning rate, with resulting positions and distances traveled quantifying model accuracy.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
▸ A test with <code>control sequence [1, 0.1, 5]</code> showed the model navigating from the origin to <code>(-2.5586, 5.1742)</code>, covering <code>5.77 units</code>. This aligns with predictions from kinematic equations, illustrating the model's precision.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
▸ Complex maneuvers like sharp turns and direction reversals were executed with high fidelity, as seen with sequences like <code>[1, 0.7, 7]</code> and <code>[-0.1, 0.8]</code>, validating the model's responsiveness to input variations.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
▸ The practical validation of the kinematic equations has established their high accuracy and reliability. Each computational step, from velocity computation to positional adjustments, adhered to theoretical expectations with precision. This thorough analysis has not only fortified the Bicycle Kinematic Model's theoretical foundations but has also illuminated its practical efficacy.
